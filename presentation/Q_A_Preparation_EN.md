## Potential Question Categories and Recommended Answers

### I. Technical Details Questions

#### Q1: What is the computational complexity of the GPR denoising algorithm? Is it suitable for real-time applications?

**Recommended Answer:**
Thank you for this important question. The computational complexity of GPR denoising is indeed a critical consideration.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- For a signal of length N, GPR has time complexity O(N³)
- In our experiments, each signal sample has 128 points, processing time is approximately a few milliseconds
- Compared to deep network inference time, GPR denoising overhead is acceptable

**Real-time Application Optimization:**
1. **Parallel Processing**: I/Q channels can be denoised in parallel
2. **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU acceleration for matrix operations
3. **Approximation Algorithms**: Sparse GP or variational inference methods
4. **Pre-computation Optimization**: For fixed SNR scenarios, kernel matrices can be pre-computed

**Practical Deployment Considerations:**
- For offline analysis scenarios, current algorithm is fully feasible
- For real-time applications, we're researching neural network-based fast denoising alternatives
- On edge computing devices, further optimization through model compression and quantization

#### Q2: Why choose 90°, 180°, 270° rotation angles? Are other angles also effective?

**Recommended Answer:**
This is an excellent question involving the theoretical foundation of data augmentation strategy.

**Selection Rationale:**
1. **Mathematical Symmetry**: Most digital modulations (PSK, QAM) have 90° rotational symmetry
2. **Phase Ambiguity**: Common carrier phase offsets in practical communications are typically multiples of 90°
3. **Label Invariance**: These angle rotations don't change the essential characteristics of modulation types

**Experiments with Other Angles:**
We also tested other angles (such as 45°, 30°):
- For strictly symmetric modulations (like QPSK), any angle is effective
- For partially symmetric modulations (like 8PSK), 45° multiples work best
- For asymmetric modulations (like AM-SSB), any rotation may destroy features

**Practical Considerations:**
- 90° multiple rotations are simplest in hardware implementation
- These angles correspond to most common phase offsets in actual systems
- Too many rotation angles may introduce noise, affecting training effectiveness

#### Q3: How is the fusion of ComplexCNN and ResNet implemented in the hybrid architecture?

**Recommended Answer:**
This is the core innovation of our architectural design.

**Fusion Strategy:**
1. **Progressive Fusion**:
   - Frontend uses ComplexCNN for initial feature extraction
   - Middle layers introduce complex residual blocks

   ```
   - Skip connections implemented in complex domain
   - Complex batch normalization stabilizes training

3. **Activation Function Selection**:
   - ModReLU preserves phase information
   - Avoids traditional ReLU destroying complex structure

**Technical Advantages:**
- ComplexCNN provides fast convergence and phase preservation
