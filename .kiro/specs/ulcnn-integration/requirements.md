# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating the ULCNN (Ultra-Lightweight Complex Neural Network) models from the existing ULCNN project into the current src structure. The integration needs to ensure library version compatibility, adapt the models to work with the existing data pipeline, and enable testing of the new models through the main.py interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to integrate ULCNN models into my existing model collection, so that I can compare their performance with other models in my framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ULCNN models are integrated THEN they SHALL be accessible through the existing main.py interface
2. WHEN a user selects ULCNN models for training THEN the system SHALL use the same data pipeline as other models
3. WHEN ULCNN models are trained THEN they SHALL save weights in the same format and location as other models

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the complex neural network dependencies to be properly adapted, so that the ULCNN models work with current TensorFlow/Keras versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the complexnn module is integrated THEN it SHALL be compatible with the current TensorFlow/Keras version
2. WHEN complex layers are used THEN they SHALL work without import errors or version conflicts
3. WHEN models use complex operations THEN they SHALL execute without runtime errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to test ULCNN models with a single epoch, so that I can verify the integration works correctly before full training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running main.py with ULCNN models THEN the system SHALL successfully train for 1 epoch
2. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL save model weights and training history
3. WHEN training fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ULCNN models to follow the existing code structure, so that they integrate seamlessly with the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ULCNN models are added THEN they SHALL be placed in the src/model directory
2. WHEN models are defined THEN they SHALL follow the same function signature pattern as existing models
3. WHEN models are imported THEN they SHALL be accessible through the models.py module

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want all five ULCNN model variants to be available, so that I can experiment with different architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete THEN all five models (MCLDNN, SCNN, MCNet, PET, ULCNN) SHALL be available
2. WHEN a specific ULCNN model is selected THEN only that model SHALL be trained/evaluated
3. WHEN multiple ULCNN models are selected THEN they SHALL all be processed according to the selection
